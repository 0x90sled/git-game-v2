#Level 2
Congratulations on making it to level two! So I see you have mastered the art of using git show. Now in order to proceed to next level, you must find out who contributed the most to this branch! Once you find out how to do this, checkout the branch name of this certain contributor.

```$ git log```

All the possible choices are commit messages.

*Hint:* to advance, figure out how to use [git show](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-show).
Once you figure the above out, the instructions on how to advance to the next level will be very clear!
