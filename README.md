#Level 5

You made it to level 5! From now on things will get a little more conceptual.
Within this branch there are four empty directories. Find out how to fill them.
In order to fill the directories you first must learn to use ```git submodule```
If you don't know what a submodule is you can learn about it [here](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).

Once they are filled, the clue to the next level lies within the answer to the riddle below. Remember to *always* read the README.
The answer may be obvious but how to get to the correct README is a bit more challenging.
Are you ready? Begin!

*Hint*: you will need **two** submodule commands to correctly fill the directories.

I take your sleep away. I can script and create objects. I am both a language and the name of a bean. What am I?
