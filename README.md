#Level 4

Looks like you know your stuff! I see you were able to find who contributed the most to the snowden branch!
On this level you will need to use a command that finds the most recent tag that is reachable from this current commit.
Once you find the name of the tag, checkout to it so you may advance.

To find the name of the tag, you will need the help of this command

IMPORTANT HINT: word-0-676767 <--- if this is your output you should only use ''word'' when you checkout to the next step.

Second Hint: When you arrive to the tag indicated, make sure to READ the README for further instructions.
