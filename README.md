#Level 3
Looks like you know your stuff!
I see you were able to find who contributed the most to the snowden branch!
On this level you will be tested on your ability to see the closest tag from this current commit.
Once you find the name of the tag, checkout to it and view the README for further instructions on how to advance. 

``READ THIS``: word-0-676767 <--- if this is your output you should only use ''word'' 
and not anything after since word would be the tag. 

*Hint:* [git describe](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe)
