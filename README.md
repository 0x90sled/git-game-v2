#Level 7

You made it to level 7! It appears you have gained a deeper knowledge of git grep!

But alas! The same malicious hackers have dispersed the contents of your next clue into another branch admist 2 commits.
Fortunately enough, we have found the commit hashes which contain the two halves to the clue.
The hashes are () and ().

You will need to find a way to somehow *pick* the two halves and merge them together.

*Hint*: [git cherry-pick]()
