#Level 6

You made it to level 6! As you have just experienced, things will be slightly harder from now on.
Within this branch are four empty directories, or as git calls them: submodules.
Submodules allow foreign repositories to be embedded within a dedicated subdirectory of the source tree, always pointed at a particular commit.
In order to fill the directories you must use the [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) command.

Once you fill the directories, the clue to the next level lies in the README of the submodule whose name is the answer to the riddle below.
The answer may be obvious but getting to the README is a bit more challenging.
Are you ready? 
Begin!

*Hint*: you will need **two** submodule commands to correctly fill the directories.

I take your sleep away.
I can script and create objects.
I am both a language and the name of a bean.
What am I?
