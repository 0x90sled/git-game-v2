#Level 3

Congratulations on making it to level 3! So I see you have mastered the art of using git show.
Now in order to proceed to next level, you must find out who contributed the most to this branch!
You can do this by running a *shorter* version of the `git log` command.
Once you find out how to do this, checkout the branch name of this certain contributor. 

We think [`git shortlog`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-shortlog) is pretty helpful in this situation, but that is just us!
