#Level 5

You made it to level 5! 
This level is a little bit different though. Within this branch there are different directories whose names are all possible answers to the riddle below.  
These directories are other git repositories, though they are a special type called submodules. 
Within the README of the directory whose name is the answer to the riddle is the instructions on how to advance to the next level.
But there is a twist! You must first figure out how to view the submodule's files. To do this you must first figure out how to use 
'''git submodule'''. Are you ready? Go!

I take your sleep away. I can script and create objects. I am both a language and the name of a bean. What am I?
