#Level 6

You made it to level 6! Awesome!!!

Just kidding not awesome! It seems we have a problem. It appears some malcious hackers have hacked GitHub and
deleted an important file in our repo that contained the hidden personal email of Edward Snowden.
They also made hundreds commits after so we can't look through the commit history by hand.
This file also contained the clue to the next level, and without it you cannot advance unless you want to spend years manually looking for it.

You must use ```git grep``` to search through the commit history to find these emails, one of which is the clue you are looking for.

*Hint:* Figure out how to use [git grep]() with appropiate flags
*Hint:* [A better hint than the one above](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928584/how-to-grep-search-committed-code-in-the-git-history)
