#Level 4
Welcome to level 4.
This level isnâ€™t as *pretty* as you might want it to be but it teaches a new view way to view the log.
Your first step is to find out what flags are needed for ```git log``` to find the tree hashes of the tree objects in this repository.
If you don't know what a tree hash is you can read more about it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects).
You can find out more about git log flags [here](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log).

Once you find the appropiate flags required to pass into ```git log``` your next step is to use them to find the commit message 
associated with the tree hash 3331d0b.

Once you find the correct commit message associated with the given tree hash, checkout to the branch of the same name.
