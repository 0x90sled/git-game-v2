#Level 5

You made it to level 5! This level is a little bit different though.
Below is a riddle whose answer is the name one of the four submodules in this branch.
Within the README of this submodule are the instructions of how to get to the next level.
The answer may be obvious but how to get to the README is a bit more challenging.
You must learn to use ```git submodule```. 
What is a submodule you may ask and how do you use the command? [Click here](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) to find out.
Are you ready? Begin!
